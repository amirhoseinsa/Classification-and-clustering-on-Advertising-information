# Classification-and-clustering-on-Advertising-information

In this code we implement a classification and clustering system for the data set of ads. The project consists of 2 sections and its structure is as follows:

    Classified Ads
        Run tf-idf
        Run word2vec
        k-NN Implementation and similarity criteria
        Implement Bayes Naive
        Implementation of evaluation criteria
        Illustration and analysis of methods accuracy
        Predict the new ad classification
    Clustering ads
        convert the ad to vector
        Implementation of the K-Means Clustering Algorithm
        Illustration and analysis of the algorithm
